    "# The Infinite Potential Well\n",
    "\n",
    "By making use of your experience of programming in Python and working in the Jupyter notebook environment these resources aim to deliver an opportunity to use code to explore quantum topics and enhance your learning. During this lesson in particular, we will be examining the simplest system for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved - the infinite potential well, in both the time-independent and time-dependent case. We will also explore the impact that a small perturbation in the potential of the system can have, which will serve as an introduction to perturbation theory."
