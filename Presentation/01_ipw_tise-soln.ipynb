The first contains the data which you wish to integrate. In our case the first argument is the probability density distribution, which we have found using the `prob_dens` function we created earlier. The second argument is an array containing the values associated with the range you wish to integrate over. Below we have created an array containing the x-positions associated with the infinite well. We have achieved this by using the `numpy.linspace` function which returns evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval."
